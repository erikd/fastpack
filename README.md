# fastpack

A fast Haskell serialization/de-serialization library

This code is still **a)** in development and **b)** incomplete. It does however
have a trivial benchmark that shows its serialization performance relative
to Haskell's [binary](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/binary),
[cereal](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cereal) and
[packer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/packer) libraries.

It is not available on Hackage yet, because it is not sufficiently usable yet.
